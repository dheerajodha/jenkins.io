The goal of this blog is to showcase the work done during the Google Summer of Code 2022 coding phases.
For a detailed description of the project, please see the link:/projects/gsoc/2022/projects/plugin-health-scoring-system/[project page].

== About Project

Plugin maintenance is an extremely important phase of a plugin’s lifecycle. Jenkins has always been active in ongoing developments which raises a need for thousands of plugins to catch up with their latest developments, in order to stay useful for a broader set of users.

We aim to fulfil this need by introducing a metric system to calculate the health score of Jenkins plugins. This health score measures the plugin’s development maturity level with the help of accurate numeric figures. This score attempts to provide an accurate picture of how much care and help a plugin needs and makes it easier for contributors to contribute. This score also allows users to make a conscious decision before installing and/or using a plugin.

There were 2 coding phases in the GSoC 2022.

== Phase 1:

In this phase, we worked on setting up the project and followed best practices while doing so. The whole application is dockerized so that it is easier for anyone to spin-up this project and test it out locally. There's continuous integration (CI) in-place for the project to make sure that new changes are tested automatically. The useful details from the Jenkins Update Center is stored inside the database to run analysis.

=== Deliverables

* Create a spring boot project connected with a PostgreSQL DB (link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/pull/3[PR])
* Dockerize the whole application (link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/pull/7[PR])
* Setup continuous integration for the project (link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/pull/10[PR])
* Store plugin details from the update center, inside the DB in JSON format (link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/pull/18[PR])

* Jenkins Online Meetup Phase 1: Demo and Presentation

== Phase 2:

In this phase, the probe engine for the probes was designed. And processes like reading the update center and executing probe engine are now running on a schedule without the need to restart the application. There are additions of useful probes running in the probe engine, which are getting listed on the UI to highlight the current state of project. 

=== Deliverables

* Design the Probe engine for the probes (link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/pull/19[PR])
* Schedule the reading of update center, and probe engine execution (link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/pull/20[PR#1] and link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/pull/30[PR#2])
* List the available probes of the application (link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/pull/27[PR])
* Add a probe (link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/pull/33[PR])

=== Next Steps

- Add more probes to the project.
- Generate the plugin health scores based on the data extracted by the probes.
- Deploy the health scores via a JSON file similar to how Jenkins Update Center does it.
- Render the detailed report of the health score of each plugin by fetching the JSON data generated above.
- [Stretch Goal] Display Plugin health score on Plugin Manager.
